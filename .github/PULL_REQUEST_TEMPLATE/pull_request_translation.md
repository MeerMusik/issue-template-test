## Anything else you would like to add?

### Adding a Translation will take some time!
1. All Languages will be checked manually
2. If the Translation is not about English or German, it will take even longer, as I need to double check them
3. How long it takes depends solely on when I can find to do the manual check
4. If nothing happened after 30 Days, feel free to add a "Push" Comment to remind me :)
5. If you have contributed enough, so that I know that you are trustworthy, I can limited the manual Check and only look for technical Problems

Thank you for your understanding!
